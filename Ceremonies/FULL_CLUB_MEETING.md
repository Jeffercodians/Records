## Vision Orientation

```
The introduction speech serves to set the vision for the club meeting; to act as a narrative starting off point for all other activities within the meeting.

The message provides enough connection to the common values of all club members to enable everyone to orient emotionally, and set the tone for interactions during the structured part meeting.
```

> Before we begin, I would like to say some orienting words to set the tone:

>We are here because we all share a common vision for what it means to be on a team.
>We have all learned first hand the value of a good leader on a team,
>	and how hard it is to become a good leader
>We share a common passion for craft.
>Each of us brings our own unique perspective to share,
>	so let us be receptive to the perspective of others.
>We share a common interest in building tools which enable the communities around us.
>When we discuss our ideas let us work to build an idea we can all share.
## Structure Orientation

```
The club structure documented by the agenda is as follow:
	The whole club acts as a singular decision making unit for club directions;
	The member operating the units script will be responsible for holding the unit to the script, maxmizing for harmony/fun
	The member operating the units script will organize the units agenda items and facilitate reducing each agenda items choices to a decision.
```

> To begin I would like to formally give an overview of existing roles.
> 	I am acting right now as the club's master of ceremonies
> 	under the advisor-ship of all club members.
> As a club unit we have one team developing a project that engages the teams passions.
> Each team unit develops one project at a time
> 	every 2 weeks teams can decide as a unit whether to:
> 		chose continue developing the project
> 		or chose to switch to a different project
> This week we will vote on whether to extend the Minecraft OTEL project or chose a different focus.

## Club Unit Business

```
Establish an outline of the topics which will be covered under the club business ritual.
```

> Before we get started we must address club business for the good of the order.
> 	we will be welcoming 3 new members into our club ranks.
> 	we will then walk the club project board
> 	Then we wil grouping up into pairs and schedule time for this weeks project work
> 	And finally, we will select and schedule the initial club committee meeting

### New Members

```
Set a welcoming tone for new members
Set a concrete boundary for when each member became a part of the club
New members must take an action themselves in front of the unit,
	to communicate to the unit that their goal is the same as the units
```

> Today we are inviting new members to join the team to add their passions and skills to our ranks.
> This club was founded with the vision of enabling artisans to focus on craft and leadership.
> We work as a team to build our skills and our visions.
> We share our knowledge freely with each other and with the world.
> We seek to build a better world with our craft.

`for each new members to join the unit:`
> <> <>, do you wish to join our ranks, to build with passion and craftt 

`if yes:`
> "Welcome, <>! You are now officially a Jeffercodian"

`If no:`
>"Welcome, <>! We are glad to have you visit to see what we are about"

### Club Stand Up

> Now we will walk the Project board for our meeting stand-up

\<short, semi-formal Club Standup>

### Pair Switching/Assignment

> In order to begin playing the first cards on our new project, we must identify pairs for this sprint and identify times to do the pairing this week.

\<informal self-organizing of pairs>

### Establish next Meeting Times

> The next meeting will be next Tuesday at the same time, 8:30 PM EST.
> How many of us expect to be able to attend?

<Informal, Ask each member if they will be able to make it>

## Project Ideation & Pitching

> Let move onto project pitches.
> Each member has 5 minutes to pitch a project idea they would like the club to consider when imagining and selecting future projects.
> Projects on the club project board can be worked on independently of club activities,
> 	however you will be accountable to the club committee to ensure the project is being managed in such a manner that the club can pick it up should they so chose.
> You may also pitch a request for a project idea,
> 	or just simply share a project idea you're working on in your own time that you do not wish to be a formal part of the club.

\<informally give each member a 5 minute pitch window, add ideas to github project board as needed>

## Active Project Refinement

>Now that we have all had time to share and record our ideas we can focus on the project at hand. 
>After refinement we will have enough work for each pair to be occupied this sprint, and pairs will be have work assigned.

\<semi-formal refinnement>

## Retro

>And now that we are at the end, lets do an informal retro.
>	What did you like?
>	what did you not like?
>	What would you do differently?
