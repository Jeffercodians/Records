## Club Policies

**Effective Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Policy Scope

Define how policies guide club structures; Define how to address failures to comply with policy; define the way the club may enact new policies, modify existing policies, or remove no longer useful policies; define how the club should test policies to ensure they achieve the desired result; define where policies are stored.
## Policy Motivations

At the core of any structured organization are policies which describe the specifics mechanisms by which the organization governs itself.  The Jeffercodians want to have fun, so policy shouldn't get in the way; but without clear policy members will have no clear path to influence the direction when not part of the in-clique, or any fair pathways to resolve disputes or disagreements.   When everyone agrees to uphold the same policies, and the policies are agreeable to everyone, harmony can be achieved within the organization.

Humans are flawed, and our policies as well planned as they may be will not all develop the way we expect.  When a policy no longer serves the group it can become a drag on motivation and leave members isolated and unable to resolve or sometimes even communicate their problems.  Therefore, a strong framework to enable the organization to react effectively to change is paramount to a successful organization.

As an organization focused on craft in engineering, the Jeffercodians see policy as the social code that runs the club; as such all changes should be tested and reviewed thoroughly before being adopted formally.
